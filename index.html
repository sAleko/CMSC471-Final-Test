        <h1>Invisible Aftershocks: COVID-19’s Mental Toll Across America</h1>
        
        <div>
            As we all know, COVID-19 was a global pandemic that affected people across the world. It led to the closure of schools, parks, restaurants, and many other public places for literally years, due to fear of spreading the virus. Only a small percentage of jobs—those deemed critical to the functioning of society—were allowed to continue, while others were forced to adapt or shut down entirely.
Since its spread to the United States in 2019, COVID-19 has claimed the lives of over a million people. The virus has impacted everyone in one way or another—whether through the loss of loved ones, jobs, or other hardships that are difficult to fully quantify.
One such hardship is the effect the pandemic had on the mental health of the American people. Unfortunately, mental health concerns were often pushed aside, as more immediate issues like death rates and unemployment took center stage. While some may not view mental health as essential, society is made up of individuals, and when individuals are affected, the larger population inevitably feels the consequences.
That is why we are going to take a deeper dive into this issue and explore how COVID-19 has affected the mental health of the U.S. population.
To do this, we will use an interactive graph that allows you to select people of various ages and backgrounds. The graph will display data on those who became depressed during the pandemic, those who continue to experience depression, and trends in mental health over time.

            We are using a dataset from the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration. This dataset contains survey responses from individuals collected both before and after the COVID-19 pandemic. It includes data from hundreds of thousands of people.
The survey asked a simple question: whether or not the respondent was experiencing depression, with the only possible answers being "yes" or "no." While this limits the range of expression regarding people's mental health, it still provides valuable insight into their overall well-being.
The dataset also includes demographic information such as sex, age, ethnicity, income, and many other categories. However, due to the large number of variables, we chose to focus on the most common and relevant ones to avoid overwhelming the user and to keep the analysis clear and straightforward.
